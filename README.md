# Project Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets

This project is based on an NLP work with Artificial Neural Networks.
The goal was to develop a predictive model to detect whether a tweet is about a real disaster or not.

## Description

This project comes from a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started)

For this project I preprocessed the text with a tokenization method. Then I create two neural networks models and evaluated which one was the more efficient.
